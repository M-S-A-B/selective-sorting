Title:Number system

Aim: To learn Object oriented programming in C++

Theory: The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element (considering ascending order) from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning. The algorithm maintains two subarrays in a given array.
1)The subarray which is already sorted. 
2)Remaining subarray which is unsorted.
In every iteration of selection sort, the minimum element (considering ascending order) from the unsorted subarray is picked and moved to the sorted subarray. 

Iteration in arrays is done using for loops.


Algorithm:

Start =>  declare and initialize an array => then perform selection sort on the array =>  End


Explanation of the algorithm:
In this code we declare and initialize an array. Then perform selection sort on the array. Then print the sorted array. Iteration in arrays is done using for loops.
